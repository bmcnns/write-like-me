				Dear Miranda,<br /><br />

				You should come over sometime, bring Zach because he seems like a good fella.  I really got along with him last time.  We haven't hung out enough -- I've been going through some things. Before you worry, let me reassure you while remaining vague that these things are gritty and rewarding.  I really am steering my own ship, or more accurately, driving my own motorboat.  And this motorboat is riddled with holes and is slowly sinking.  But never the less, they don't call me Captain Bryce MacInnis for nothing do they?  But truly, while going through these tumultuous times I find myself looking back in nostalgia at the life that slowly faded to mist over the past few years.  Basically, I am running through the airport to leave everyone in this deprived swine of a friend group that we have.  By the way, that's how I've been describing the bunch of us -- as a friend group. Which is surely no compliment, any real friend group I'd declare the hooligans, the bohemian beasts, the conquerers of dreams, or whatever communist gobbly-guk I can spin up at time.  I guess my dissatisfaction has risen past levels where I could look away and hope that things will change.  Luckily, I haven't known you as long as the others and by some property that means you haven't seen the worse sides of me.  You've might have heard stories of a wilder side of myself but looking back on it now, most of my perhaps humorous rap sheet is in bad taste.  There's a few things I haven't regretted that others may expect I have -- for example: getting alcohol poisoning two months into University; getting a concussion while skateboarding, props to you for doing that.  It takes really big balls to do such a thing. I hate to speak in such young adolescent slang now but for the chronologically challenged: "Real recognizes real, Miranda."  I don't know if you have been back on the board since but I so highly recommend that you do.  Even if you realize the life of skateboarding isn't for you, the mind can be mean sometimes and twist truths into falsehoods after a great stretch of time.  I want you to feel that quitting skateboarding was your choice and a period of growth for you rather than quitting out of fear of further injury.  That's what I expect to be already true but over time the brain can play nasty tricks on you. I've been writing far too long already and can feel the arthritis in my fingers already.  My recent mode de vie has left me feeling 42 rather than 21.  Before I forget, getting onto that comment about the legacy of bad-taste.  There are a few people I wish to make amends with but overwhelmingly, I want to leave the social dynamics we currently weather in the past.  Some things are meant to be left in the past.  No hard feelings to those people but I am sick of the close-minded, judgemental and quick-to-turn hyena culture plaguing us.  It was never good to begin with, I'm not clinging to it anymore.<br /><br />

Still,<br />
Bryce MacInnis

				I am eavesdropping on the neighbour below<br />
				While I smoke my pipe<br />
				Filled with marijuana smoke<br />
				Nostalgic brain patterns<br />
				While I sip my glass of red wine<br />
				$20 from the store<br />
				where the cashier carded me<br />
				and I tried something new<br />
				where I just showed him my ID<br />
				in my wallet without taking it out<br />
				It's half hearted but with these eyebags<br />
				who really thinks I'm a young kid?<br />
				Or what in the hell is happening to young kids<br />
				where anyone can think that they are young still<br />
				The neighbour below was a youthful young girl<br />
				Full of virulent conversation<br />
				Full of tales from the office<br />
				Full of fun anecdotes<br />
				Fully amicable<br />
				As I smoked my marijuana I worried<br />
				that she would hate me where I stood<br />
				for smelling up the room<br />
				of the outside world<br />
				But she kept talking with her friend<br />
				She didn't comment when I turned my jazz from being<br />
				obnoxiously loud to very quiet.<br />
				Maybe my own private personal radio station is broadcasting to some households.<br />
				Maybe there are people with me as I smoke my pipe and listen to my <br />
				Billie Holliday<br />
				Louis Armstrong<br />
				Thelonious Monk,<br />
				et al.<br />
				Thank you for making me feel not-so-alone
